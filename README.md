Ben & Jerry's Scraper
=====================
This is a web scraper that extracts data from the flavor locator on the Ben & Jerry's website to let you know which stores near you sell the ice cream and what flavors they stock. The CSV outputed from this tool is designed to use something like Google Fusion tables to geocode the address field and return the results on a map. Now you know where to go to find the sweet ice cream goodness of your choice.
