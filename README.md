Ben & Jerry's Scraper
=====================
This is a web scraper that extracts data from the flavor locator on the [Ben & Jerry's website](http://www.benjerry.com) to let you know which stores near you sell the ice cream and what flavors they stock. The CSV outputed from this tool is designed to use something like [Google Fusion Tables](http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html#fusiontables) to geocode the address field and return the results on a map. Now you know where to go to find the sweet ice cream goodness of your choice.

The output data can also be used to build a [Ben & Jerry's API](https://github.com/fab/benandjerrys_api).
